# @mindpeeker/entropy

Provider-pluggable **quantum (QRNG)** and **true (TRNG)** randomness for web and Node.js.

Eleven entropy backends behind one tiny interface, with composable combining strategies
(fallback chains, XOR mixing, racing), request/response *and* streaming access, and honest
source attribution — every result tells you where its bytes actually came from.

- **Runtime-agnostic**: standard `fetch`, `WebSocket`, `globalThis.crypto` only. Zero dependencies. ESM. Node ≥ 20.3 and evergreen browsers.
- **Exactly-n-or-throw**: `getBytes(n)` always resolves with exactly `n` bytes or throws a typed `EntropyError` — per-request caps and chunking are each provider's internal concern.
- **Honest metadata**: providers are classified by `kind` (`qrng` / `trng` / `beacon` / `csprng`) and `privacy` (`private` / `public`) so you can't accidentally seed a secret from a public beacon.

```sh
npm install @mindpeeker/entropy    # or bun add @mindpeeker/entropy
```

## Quick start

```ts
import { anuLegacy, cryptoProvider, fallback } from '@mindpeeker/entropy'

// The classic: try quantum first, fall back to the local CSPRNG — and know which one served.
const entropy = fallback([anuLegacy(), cryptoProvider()])

const { bytes, sources } = await entropy.getBytes(32)
console.log(sources.map((s) => s.name)) // ['anu-legacy'] … or ['crypto'] if ANU was down
```

## Providers

| Factory | Source | Kind | Privacy | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `cryptoProvider()` | runtime CSPRNG | csprng | private | — | always available; last link of every good fallback chain |
| `anu({ apiKey })` | ANU quantum vacuum | qrng | private | `x-api-key` (AWS Marketplace) | ≤1024 numbers/request (chunked automatically) |
| `anuLegacy()` | ANU quantum vacuum | qrng | private | none | **1 request/minute** (client-side gate built in); retirement announced |
| `qrandomIo()` | IDQ Quantis photonics | qrng | private | none | free; Falcon-512-signed responses (not verified in v1) |
| `lfdr()` | IDQ Quantis PCIe | qrng | private | none | hobby-grade lab service, no SLA |
| `outshift({ apiKey })` | Cisco photonic QRNG | qrng | private | `x-id-api-key` (free signup) | 100k bits/day free tier |
| `qci({ apiToken })` | QCi photonic uQRNG | qrng | private | OAuth2 token exchange | bearer token cached; auto re-auth on 401 |
| `randomOrg({ apiKey })` | atmospheric radio noise | trng | private | JSON-RPC apiKey | honors `advisoryDelay`; 250k bits/day free |
| `superRand({ apiKey })` | EM background noise | trng | private | key in query | **WebSocket streaming**; ≤256 values/request; wire format live-verified |
| `drand()` | League of Entropy (threshold BLS) | beacon | **public** | none | 3 s rounds, 32 B each; mirror failover built in |
| `nistBeacon()` | NIST full-entropy source | beacon | **public** | none | 512 bits/min; NIST: *never use as secret keys* |
| `cameraEntropy()` | camera sensor noise (shot/thermal) | trng | private | camera permission | frame-diff sign bits (AetherOnePi-style); browser or injected frames |
| `micEntropy()` | microphone ADC noise | trng | private | mic permission | sample LSBs; browser or injected PCM |
| `serialEntropy({...})` | ESP32 / TrueRNG / OneRNG over serial | trng | private | — | Web Serial `port` or any injected byte `source` |
| `jitterEntropy()` | CPU timing jitter | trng | private | — | Node `hrtime` (credited 1/16 bit/delta); browser only via `allowCoarseClock` |

All network providers accept `fetch` (dependency injection / proxying) and a base-URL override.

## Local physical entropy

The four local providers share one pipeline: raw physical samples → **continuous NIST SP 800-90B
health tests** (Repetition Count + Adaptive Proportion, always on) → **SHA-256 extraction** with a
conservative per-source entropy credit — or, with `conditioning: 'raw'`, a health-tested
passthrough of the unwhitened physical bits (the provider then reports itself as `name(raw)` in
attribution, so results are always traceable). A failing source throws
`EntropyError('health_test')` — it never silently degrades to pseudo-randomness.

```ts
import { cameraEntropy, serialEntropy, xorMix, cryptoProvider } from '@mindpeeker/entropy'

// Browser webcam, whitened:
const cam = cameraEntropy() // getUserMedia; cover the lens for pure thermal noise

// Raw hotbits for oracle/radionics workflows — unwhitened frame-diff sign bits:
const rawCam = cameraEntropy({ conditioning: 'raw' })

// Defense in depth stays available:
const belt = xorMix([cam, cryptoProvider()])
```

### ESP32 (AetherOnePi firmware)

Flash the [AetherOnePi ESP32 sketch](https://github.com/isuretpolos/AetherOnePi) (streams raw
`esp_fill_random` bytes at 921 600 baud — keep `bootloader_random_enable()` on) and read it:

```ts
// Browser (Chromium, Web Serial):
const port = await navigator.serial.requestPort()
const esp32 = serialEntropy({ port, name: 'esp32' })

// Node (macOS/Linux, zero deps — stty + fs):
import { nodeSerialSource } from '@mindpeeker/entropy/node'
const esp32 = serialEntropy({
  source: await nodeSerialSource({ path: '/dev/cu.usbserial-110' }),
  name: 'esp32',
})
```

TrueRNG v3 works the same way (plain CDC read); OneRNG needs its init command via the
`init` option (check onerng.info for your firmware).

### Node camera & microphone

Node has no `getUserMedia`; inject frames/PCM — the built-in adapters spawn `ffmpeg`
(must be installed) with zero npm dependencies:

```ts
import { ffmpegFrameSource, ffmpegSampleSource, hwRng } from '@mindpeeker/entropy/node'

cameraEntropy({ source: ffmpegFrameSource({ device: '0' }) })        // avfoundation index / /dev/video0
micEntropy({ source: ffmpegSampleSource({ device: ':0' }) })         // ':0' avfoundation / 'default' alsa
hwRng()                                                              // /dev/hwrng (usually root-only)
```

## Measured performance

Real measurements from `bun scripts/bench.ts` (Apple Silicon macOS, Bun 1.3, residential
connection, 2026-07-07 — rerun it yourself; results vary with network, hardware and light):

| Rank | Provider | Kind | Transport | Request | Latency | Effective rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `crypto` | csprng | in-process | 1 MiB | 1 ms | ~870 MiB/s | baseline, not physical entropy |
| 2 | `esp32` (raw) | trng | USB serial 921600 | 16 KiB | 233 ms | **~69 KiB/s** | AetherOnePi firmware, near wire speed |
| 3 | `esp32` (conditioned) | trng | USB serial 921600 | 2 KiB | 65 ms | ~31 KiB/s | SHA-256, 2× credit |
| 4 | `jitter` | trng | in-process | 1 KiB | 112 ms | ~9 KiB/s | hrtime deltas, conditioned |
| 5 | `camera` (raw) | trng | ffmpeg avfoundation | 1 KiB | 1.9 s | ~540 B/s | debiased sign bits |
| 6 | `lfdr.de` | qrng | https | 64 B | 139 ms | ~460 B/s | free, keyless |
| 7 | `random.org` | trng | https | 64 B | 196 ms | ~330 B/s | 250k bits/day |
| 8 | `qrandom.io` | qrng | https | 64 B | 232 ms | ~280 B/s | free, keyless |
| 9 | `outshift` | qrng | https | 64 B | 475 ms | ~135 B/s | 100k bits/day |
| 10 | `nist-beacon` | beacon | https | 64 B | 677 ms | ~95 B/s | PUBLIC bits |
| 11 | `drand` | beacon | https | 64 B | 890 ms | ~72 B/s | PUBLIC bits, 2 rounds |
| 12 | `anu` (keyed) | qrng | https | 64 B | 980 ms | ~65 B/s | quantum vacuum |
| 13 | `superrand` (REST) | trng | https | 64 B | 1.3 s | ~51 B/s | ≤256 values/request |
| 14 | `camera` (conditioned) | trng | ffmpeg | 64 B | 3.6 s | ~18 B/s | warmup + 8× credit dominate |
| 15 | `anu-legacy` | qrng | https | 16 B | 1.1 s | ~14 B/s | hard 1 req/min limit |

Reading the numbers:

- **Cloud rates are latency-bound**, not throughput limits — a 64-byte request costs one round
  trip, so bigger requests amortize much better (e.g. `random.org` serves up to 128 KiB per call).
- **The ESP32 is by far the fastest physical source** — orders of magnitude ahead of any cloud
  QRNG — which is exactly why local hardware is worth the USB cable.
- **Camera small reads pay fixed costs** (auto-exposure warmup + the deliberately paranoid 8×
  extraction credit). Streaming or raw mode is where it shines; covered-lens thermal mode works too.
- For **bulk + strongest-source guarantees**, mix fast local with a cloud QRNG:
  `xorMix([serialEntropy({...}), anu({...})])` costs one round trip regardless of size.

### Honest labels

- `jitterEntropy()` in the browser requires `allowCoarseClock: true` and is named
  `jitter(coarse)`: real but **unquantified** entropy — only ever mix it via `xorMix`,
  never use it alone. The Node variant (nanosecond `hrtime`) is credited very
  conservatively at 1/16 bit per timing delta.
- Camera/mic quality varies wildly with device DSP (auto-exposure, noise suppression);
  the health tests are the guard, and cheap sensors are often *better* entropy sources.

## Combining strategies

Strategies implement the same `EntropyProvider` interface, so they nest arbitrarily.

```ts
import { anu, cryptoProvider, drand, fallback, race, randomOrg, xorMix } from '@mindpeeker/entropy'

// Priority order, first success wins:
fallback([anu({ apiKey }), randomOrg({ apiKey }), cryptoProvider()])

// Defense in depth: XOR of independent sources is as strong as the STRONGEST one.
// Fails closed — if any member fails, the call fails (wrap in fallback to degrade).
xorMix([anu({ apiKey }), cryptoProvider()])

// Latency-critical: all providers start, fastest response wins, losers are aborted.
race([anu({ apiKey }), randomOrg({ apiKey })])

// Composition: auditable-but-private, and never fails:
fallback([xorMix([drand(), cryptoProvider()]), cryptoProvider()])
```

**XOR privacy rule**: mixing a *public* beacon with at least one *independent private* source
yields a **private** result (`xorMix` reports `privacy: 'private'` if any member is private) —
the beacon adds public auditability without exposing the output. The independence of the
sources is your assumption to keep: don't feed the same upstream in twice.

`fallback` and `race` report the *pessimistic* privacy (public if any member is public),
because you can't know statically which member will serve.

## Streaming

Every provider has a lazy, pull-based `stream()` (`AsyncIterable<Uint8Array>`):

```ts
for await (const chunk of drand().stream()) {
  // one 32-byte value per new drand round (every ~3 s), deduplicated
}

// SuperRand streams over its WebSocket API with tagged in-flight requests,
// transparent reconnects (3 attempts, exponential backoff) and clean teardown:
for await (const chunk of superRand({ apiKey }).stream({ chunkBytes: 64 })) { /* … */ }
```

Default streams poll `getBytes` per pull, so provider rate limits are honored automatically
(`anuLegacy().stream()` naturally emits at most one chunk per minute). Stop a stream with
`break` / `return()` or an `AbortSignal`.

## Errors

Everything throws `EntropyError` with a `code`:
`rate_limited` (with `retryAfterMs` when known) · `auth` · `network` · `bad_response` ·
`insufficient_entropy` · `timeout` · `aborted` · `invalid_request` · `health_test`
(a local source failed its continuous NIST health tests).

When a strategy exhausts all members, you get `insufficient_entropy` whose `cause` is an
`AggregateError` holding each member's error in attempt order.

```ts
try {
  await provider.getBytes(64, { timeoutMs: 5000, signal })
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof EntropyError && error.code === 'rate_limited') {
    console.log(`retry in ${error.retryAfterMs}ms`)
  }
}
```

## Custom providers

```ts
import { defineProvider } from '@mindpeeker/entropy'

const myQrng = defineProvider({
  name: 'my-hardware',
  kind: 'qrng',
  privacy: 'private',
  async getBytes(n, { signal } = {}) {
    const bytes = await readFromMyDevice(n, signal)
    return { bytes, sources: [{ name: 'my-hardware', kind: 'qrng', privacy: 'private' }] }
  },
})
```

`defineProvider` gives you length validation, abort handling, whole-call timeouts and a
default poll-based `stream()` for free.

## Browser caveats

- **API keys in browser code are public.** For keyed providers, proxy server-side and point
  the provider at your proxy via `baseUrl` — or use only keyless providers client-side.
- CORS support is unverified for several keyless services (lfdr, qrandom.io); if a provider
  is blocked by CORS in the browser, route it through a small proxy.
- Node 20 has no global `WebSocket` (Node ≥ 21 does): pass `superRand({ WebSocketCtor })`,
  e.g. from the `ws` package.

## Verifying against live APIs

Mocked tests are authoritative for CI. To exercise real endpoints:

```sh
LIVE=1 bun test live                      # keyless providers
LIVE=1 ANU_API_KEY=… RANDOM_ORG_API_KEY=… bun test live   # + keyed ones
```

Instead of exporting keys inline, copy the workspace's `.env.example` to `.env` (git-ignored)
and fill in what you have — Bun loads it automatically, and each keyed provider's live test
runs only when its variable is set.

The live suite loads the nearest `.env` itself (walking up from the test file), so it works
from the workspace root and from inside `packages/entropy` alike.
